# Deep-Learning
Neural Networks and Deep Learning using Tensorflow

Given a set of training examples xi with their labels yt the model will:

1.	Initialize the classifier with random weight w
2.	Feed a training example in the classifier and get the output yp
3.	Compute the loss between the prediction yt and yp
4.	Adjust the weights w according to the loss (error)
5.	Repeat for all training examples.
